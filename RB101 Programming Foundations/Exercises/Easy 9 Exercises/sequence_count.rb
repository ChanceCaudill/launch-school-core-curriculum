# Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. 
# The first argument is a count, and the second is the first 
# number of a sequence that your method will create. 
# The method should return an Array that contains the same number 
# of elements as the count argument, while the values of each 
# element will be multiples of the starting number.

# You may assume that the count argument will always have a value 
# of 0 or greater, while the starting number can be any integer value. 
# If the count is 0, an empty list should be returned.
def sequence(count, number)
  result = []

  if count == 0
    result
  else
    (1..count).each do |num|
      result << (number * num)
    end
  end

  result
end

# Examples:
puts sequence(5, 1) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
puts sequence(4, -7) == [-7, -14, -21, -28]
puts sequence(3, 0) == [0, 0, 0]
puts sequence(0, 1000000) == []
